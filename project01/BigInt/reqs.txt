TO-DO:
- Input-output operators (<<, >>)
- Constructors: 
    default constructor, 
    constructor with int parameter, 
    constructor with string representation of an integer number (This constructor has to throw runtime_error exception if the
    string argument is an invalid representation of BigInt value)

- Operators: +, -, *, /, %, += , -=, *=, /=, %=, prefix and postfix ++ and --, unary -, unary +.
- Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

In the case of division by zero you have to throw runtime_error exception. 
Check how g++
compiler (in C++11 mode) works with expressions like 3 / -2 or -5 % 10 and emulate this
behavior in your class. Multiplication and division by numbers of type int can be implemented
more efficiently and should be overloaded in your class.
